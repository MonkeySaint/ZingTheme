# ZingTheme
Update of the zing theme for pterodactyl with the original source here https://github.com/Fredthedoggy/FrogPanel
It is not a perfect update but it gets the job done.
Missing features are the "fancy side panel" and some secanday colors.
Bigger Console and Files In File View work perfect
To install the theme follow this guide
